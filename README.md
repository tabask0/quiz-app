## Security Implementation

### Answer Obfuscation

Correct answers are stored using hexadecimal obfuscation and XOR encryption to prevent easy inspection:

```typescript
// Answers are obfuscated using bitwise operations
correctAnswers: q.correctAnswers.map((ans: number) => (ans + 0x1f2e) ^ 0xabcd);
```

### Anti-Inspection Measures
